**Notes:**

Updating this project to a new makefile template. Also, all required resources are in the project folder now.

**Old readme:**

oscbonjour - a PD external for browsing/resolving and registering

This is a port of the oscbonjour Max/MSP external by Remy Muller

To compile you will need osctools, as found at:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/osctools/

then modify the makefile so that ZEROCONF-SRC points to
osctools/zeroconf and type:

make 
sudo make install

from the current directory
